You can create and edit content with your user account and if you choose to do so, you can publish and share such content.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription to Beta Service</strong></p>
<p>We may offer certain Services as closed or open beta services ("Beta Service" or &ldquo;Beta Services&rdquo;) for the purpose of testing and evaluation. You agree that we have the sole authority and discretion to determine the period of time for testing and evaluation of Beta Services. We will be the sole judge of the success of such testing and the decision, if any, to offer the Beta Services as commercial services. You will be under no obligation to acquire a subscription to use any paid Service as a result of your subscription to any Beta Service. We reserve the right to fully or partially discontinue, at any time and from time to time, temporarily or permanently, any of the Beta Services with or without notice to you.

You may terminate your use of the Services by providing LKIN notice by email within 30 days of being notified of the availability of the modified Terms if the Terms are modified in a manner that substantially affects your rights in connection with use of the Services. In the event of such termination, you will be entitled to prorated refund of the unused portion of any prepaid fees.

<p><strong>User Sign up Obligations</strong></p>
<p>You need to sign up for a user account by providing all required information in order to access or use the Services. If you represent an organization and wish to use the Services for corporate internal use, we recommend that you, and all other users from your organization, sign up for user accounts by providing your corporate contact information. In particular, we recommend that you use your corporate email address. You agree to: a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the sign up process; and b) maintain and promptly update the information provided during sign up to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete.

<p><strong>Organization Accounts and Administrators</strong></p>
<p>When you sign up for an account for your organization you may specify one or more administrators. The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account. If your organization account is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for your organization.

You may specify a process to be followed for recovering control in the event of such loss of control of the administrator accounts by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:legal@mbilling.in">legal@mbilling.in</a> , provided that the process is acceptable to LKIN. In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, LKIN may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to LKIN demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold LKIN liable for the consequences of any action taken by LKIN in good faith in this regard.</p>
