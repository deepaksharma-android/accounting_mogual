<p style="text-align:center"><strong>App Detailed Description</strong></p>
<p>Real-time broadcast of air quality and concentration of particulate matter in the air in your area. Get to know quality of air and necessary protective measures for yourself and your family from the recommendations given by Air Index - U.S.</p>
<p>Select location of your choice or let the app get your current location to obtain Air quality index. Save locations if you travel a lot. Stay healthy by taking protective measures against the harsh environment out there. The app suggests various measures for staying fit even in bad quality air.</p>
<p>App also provides the concentration of particulate matter (PM 2.5) in the dashboard. Higher PM values can badly affect your &amp; your family&rsquo;s health. The app provides viable protective measures recommended by doctors in toxic air conditions.</p>
<p><em>Nomenclature:</em></p>
<p><em>Air Quality Index:</em> It is a scale that expresses the quality of breathing air outside in the environment valued in between 0 to 500. Higher the value lower the quality of Air. Please follow recommendations in the app, if AQI values are higher than 100 in your area.</p>
<p><em>Particulate Matter:</em> It comprises of solid suspended particles in air as well as some liquid vapors. PM2.5 refers to particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometer size. PM10 refers to particles of size 10 micrometer.</p>

<p><strong>Air Quality Index</strong></p>
<p>Air quality index (AQI) is a scale for expressing quality of air in the environment. The scale is numbered from 0 to 500. The higher the value of AQI, greater the level of air pollution and eventually more health concern. Environmental protection agency (EPA) calculates the AQI by combining the effect of five major air pollutants. These five pollutants are:</p>
<p>Particulate matter</p>
<p>Ground-level Ozone</p>
<p>Sulfur dioxide</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide and</p>
<p>Nitrogen dioxide</p>
<p>For each of these pollutants EPA has defined air quality standards to protect public health. The standard value of AQI, set by EPA, is 100 for permissible pollutant levels in air. Any AQI value less than 100 is generally considered as safe and satisfactory. If AQI rise above 100, it is considered as unhealthy. There are people who are more sensitive to quality of breathing air around them. First the AQI is set for them then for everyone else as AQI value get higher.</p>
